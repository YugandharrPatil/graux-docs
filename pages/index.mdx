# What is Graux Protocol?
 
**Graux Protocol** is a complete and fully decentralized stack development platform that is driven by data 
and can be easily integrated into any application. The primary objective of the platform is to speed up the 
transition of the world towards the multichain and make interoprablility. With the help of their robust software 
development kits (SDKs), developers can now concentrate on creating engaging user experiences instead of spending 
their time on the technical complexities of the development process.

## Products

<Steps>
    ### DNS layer:
    
    A decentralized naming system like Handshake to map domain names to IP addresses on the decentralized web.

    ### Node infrastructure layer:
    
    Set up node infrastructure to run and maintain the network. 
    This layer includes the various components required to run a decentralized network, such as validators, 
    relayers, and nodes.

    ### General compute layer:
    
    A general compute layer to enable developers to build decentralized applications 
    on top of the network. This layer should provide a secure and scalable environment for running decentralized applications.

    ### Wallet layer:
    
    A decentralized wallet to enable users to interact with the network and manage their digital assets securely.

    ### Fiat on-ramp and off-ramp layer: 
    
    Building an on-ramp and off-ramp system to enable users to easily buy and sell digital assets using fiat currencies.

    ### Data storage layer:
    
    A decentralized data storage solution like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) to store and retrieve data on the network.

    ### Data indexing layer: 
    
    A data indexing layer like The Graph to enable developers to quickly search and query data on the network.

    ### Oracle layer: 
    
    Integrate a decentralized oracle solution like [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) OR [Pythnet](https://pyth.network/) 
    to provide accurate and reliable data to smart contracts and decentralized applications.

    ### Cross-chain bridge layer:
    
    A cross-chain bridge to enable interoperability between different blockchains and networks.

    ### CDN layer: 
    
    A content delivery network to ensure fast and reliable content delivery on the network.

    ### ISP layer:
     
    A decentralized ISP like Helium to provide a decentralized connectivity layer for IoT devices on the network.

    ### Version control layer:
    
    Implement a decentralized version control system to enable developers to collaborate and manage 
    code changes in a decentralized manner.**simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** site generation framework with everything 
    you love from Next.js.
