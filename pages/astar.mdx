# What is Astar Network?

Astar is a parachain that facilitates communication and interoperability between Polkadot and other prominent 
Layer-1 blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Acala, and potentially Cosmos.

Through Astar, developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) more quickly and cost-effectively, 
thanks to the platform's high throughput, low transaction fees, and fast finality. Additionally, Astar's 
compatibility with Polkadot enables different blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, to work 
together seamlessly, eliminating the need for centralized exchanges.

# What is Astar Network API?

The Astar API provides a way for applications to interface with an Astar node, which is a component of the 
broader Astar network. Developers can utilize the API's endpoints to interact with on-chain data and submit 
various transactions to the network.The API conforms to the JSON-RPC standard, which is a remote procedure 
call (RPC) protocol that utilizes JSON for data encoding. JSON-RPC is lightweight and stateless, making it 
well-suited for use in distributed systems and client-server architectures. By utilizing the Astar API, 
developers can integrate their applications with the Astar network in a secure and efficient manner.

# How Astar improved performance and scalability?

Astar is a parachain that operates within the Polkadot network, serving a similar function to Layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network.
Put simply, a parachain is a separate blockchain network that runs in parallel to the main [Polkadot chain](https://polkadot.network/) (known as the Relay Chain), 
and benefits from the underlying chain's core functionality and security features. Parachains are designed 
to enhance the scalability and interoperability of the Polkadot ecosystem, by providing specialized functionality 
and services that can be integrated with other networks and applications.
