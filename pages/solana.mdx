# What is Solana?

Solana's unique architecture is built around a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Proof of History (PoH), 
which enables it to process transactions more quickly than traditional blockchain platforms. This is achieved 
by separating the tasks of network consensus and transaction processing, allowing Solana to achieve high 
throughput and low latency. Additionally, Solana offers a programming language called Rust and a suite of 
development tools to help developers build decentralized applications with ease.


# What is Solana API?

The Solana API is a set of protocols, tools, and endpoints that developers can use to build applications 
on the Solana blockchain. The Solana API includes a range of methods that developers can use to query information about the blockchain, 
such as transaction history, account balances, and program data. It also provides methods for submitting transactions 
and deploying smart contracts by leveraging **Graux's** API endpoints. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard, a lightweight, 
remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used when interacting with blockchain data.

# What methods does Graux support for the Solana API?
You can find the list of all the methods Graux support for the Solana API on the [Solana API Endpoints](../solana/solana-end-points) page.
