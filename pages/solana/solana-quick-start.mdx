# Solana API Quickstart
Quickstart guide for building on Solana


## Getting Started Instructions

<Steps>
###  Choose a package manager (npm or yarn)

For this guide, you will be using npm or yarn as our package manager to install graux-sdk or other packages.


### Set up your project (npm or yarn)

**npm:** To get started with npm, follow the documentation to install Node.js and npm for your operating system: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

```js filename="Terminal (npm)" {4} copy
  mkdir graux-solana-api
  cd graux-solana-api
  npm init --yes
```

**yarn:** To get started with yarn, follow these steps: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

```js filename="Terminal (yarn)" {4} copy
  mkdir graux-solana-api
  cd graux-solana-api
  yarn init --yes
```

### Install Solana Web3.js Library

Run the following command to install the Solana Web3.js library with npm or yarn.

```js filename="npm" {2} copy
  npm install --save @solana/web3.js
```
```js filename="yarn" {2} copy
  yarn add @solana/web3.js
```

### Make your first request
You are all set now to use Solana API and make your first request. For instance, lets make a request 
to get latest slot. Create an index.js file and paste the following code snippet into the file.

``` js filename="index.js" {12} copy
  const solanaWeb3 = require("@solana/web3.js");

  const main = async () => {
    rpc = "https://solana-mainnet.graux.com/v1/<Your-Graux-API-Key>"; // RPC URL for connecting with a Solana node
    connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(rpc, "confirmed"); // confirming the connection

    let slot = await connection.getSlot(); // getting the most recent slot number
    console.log("The latest slot number is", slot); // logging the most recent slot number
  };

  main();
```

### Run script
To run the above node script, use cmd ```node index.js```, and you should see the output.

```js filename="Terminal" {2} copy
  The latest slot number is 174140717
```

</Steps>

## For Solana RPC Requests, use Graux's AccountsDB Infrastructure!

The getProgramAccounts and getLargestTokenAccounts methods on Solana can be quite expensive because they 
require scanning accounts, which puts a heavy load on validator nodes. This often leads to long wait times 
or even errors.

To address this issue, Graux has developed an infrastructure called AccountsDB that sits on top of our 
validator nodes. This infrastructure is designed to support these methods and provide faster, more scalable, 
and more reliable responses. It achieves this by paginating the response with a pageKey, which enables you to 
loop through the same request and aggregate the full response from our validator nodes.

We have updated our Solana documentation to reflect this change, and you will now find that pageKey is an 
optional parameter in each account-scanning method. Additionally, you can include an optional parameter to 
sort the accounts in the response by their pubkey field.

Here's an example with getProgramAccounts:
```js filename="Typescript" {44} copy
  const axios = require("axios");

  function getProgramAccountsExample() {
  let gPAExampleRequest = {
    "method": "graux_getProgramAccounts",
    "params": [
      "ZETAxsqBRek56DhiGXrn75yj2NHU3aYUnxvHXpkf3aD",
      {
        "encoding": "base64",
        "withContext": true,
        "order": "desc"
      }
    ],
    "id": 0,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
  }
  let programAccounts = []

  const grauxRPCUrl = "https://solana-mainnet.graux.com/v1/<YOUR-API-KEY>"
  try {
    let response = await axios.post(url, gPAExampleRequest);
    let responseData = response.data["result"]
    
    // continue aggregating if there's a new pageKey present in the latest response
    while (responseData["pageKey"]) {
      programAccounts = programAccounts.concat(responseData["value"]);
      
      // place the pagekey within the optional config object
      // (you may need to create that config object if you didn't have it originally)
      gPAExampleRequest["params"][1]["pageKey"] = responseData["pageKey"];
      
      // make another call to getProgramAccounts with the pageKey
      response = await axios.post(url, gPAExampleRequest);
      responseData = response.data["result"]
    }

      programAccounts = programAccounts.concat(responseData["value"]);
      return programAccounts;
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`Error in Response, Data is: ${err.data}`);
      return [];
    }
  }
```
